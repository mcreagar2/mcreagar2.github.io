								<h5><em>Abstract:</em> We introduce a simple and natural iterative version of the well-known and widely studied Markov rating method. We show that this iterative Markov method converges to the usual global Markov rating, 
									and shares a close relationship with the well-known Elo rating. Together with recent results on the relationship between the global Markov method and the maximum likelihood estimate of the rating 
									vector in the Bradley–Terry (BT) model, we connect and explore the global and iterative Markov, Elo, and Bradley–Terry ratings on real and simulated data.</h5>

				<h5><em>Abstract:</em> A number of papers have described methods to include transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) in the development of metabolic models. However, in general, these models do not allow for statistical 
					uncertainty in TRN interactions. Furthermore, methods which do allow for uncertainty do so in a non-rigorous manner which, effectively, downweights prior transcriptomics data to the point where it has little impact on the resulting model. 
					To combat these limitations, we developed an integrated metabolic regulatory model (iMRM). This novel approach explicitly models the statistical uncertainty in gene state activity inferences by using gene activity state estimates, and the iMRM 
					process measures the flux through reactions for a sole single-cell organism. This allows for benefits such as differential thresholds for gene activity for different genes, a stronger correlation with experimental flux data, and the application 
					of a non-Boolean confidence metric. Furthermore, this is the first such metabolic model to be grounded on a statistically rigorous foundation.</h5>

								to large sets of genetic data", <em>Under Revision</em>.</p>
								<h5><em>Abstract:</em> The impact of genotypic uncertainty (e.g., genotype errors) in sequence data on gene-based tests of phenotype association (e.g., variance-components and burden tests) 
									are fairly well understood with genotype errors that are not associated with the phenotype of interest reducing power and genotype errors that are associated with the phenotype 
									increasing the type I error rate. However, little work has been done to establish how these patterns manifest themselves in large ‘biobank’ style datasets, where data has been 
									aggregated from numerous sources each with potentially different patterns of genotype uncertainty. In this manuscript we use simulated data to demonstrate the aggregate effects
									of genotype uncertainty on downstream statistical analyses in biobank-style datasets. We then propose two methods to adjust downstream data processing to mitigate the impact of 
									these errors in order to appropriately control the type I error rate while maximizing statistical power.</h5>
